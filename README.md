# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


I build a Car Clicker Game using react, I managed to achieve implementing the useState Hook and useEffect. I used upgrades for my components to help create my cookie clicker, I also used setInterval and the .map() function. Also I managed to use logic to be able to buy items in the game. I believe I achieved everything I could in this project, I feel as though I could have made it so it comes up with an error when you cannot buy something, and I found the local host quite difficult as I could not work out how to get it to stay when you refresh the page. I used Youtube to help with some parts and google too. I believe I did a good job with the CSS and working through all of that, I feel as though I could have made it easier for myself by doing one function rather than multiple.
