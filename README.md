# React + Vite

Deployed With Vercel - https://my-sixth-assignment.vercel.app/

I built a Car Clicker Game using React, I managed to implement the useState Hook and useEffect. I used upgrades for my components to help create my cookie clicker, I also used setInterval and the .map() function. Also, I managed to use logic to be able to buy items in the game. I believe I achieved everything I could in this project, I feel as though I could have made it so it comes up with an error when you cannot buy something, and I found the local host quite difficult as I could not work out how to get it to stay when you refresh the page. I used YouTube to help with some parts and google too. I believe I did a good job with the CSS and working through all of that, I feel as though I could have made it easier for myself by doing one function rather than multiple.
